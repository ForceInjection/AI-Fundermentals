# GPU Example: RTX 5000

It's fine to have a general understanding of what graphics processing units can be used for, and to know conceptually how they work. But at the actual hardware level, what does a particular GPU consist of, if one peeks "under the hood"? Sometimes the best way to learn about a certain type of device is to consider one or two concrete examples. Here we'll be taking a detailed look at the Quadro RTX 5000, a GPU which is found in TACC's Frontera. In a previous topic, we did a similar deep dive into the [Tesla V100](tesla_v100.md), one of the NVIDIA models that has been favored for HPC applications.
